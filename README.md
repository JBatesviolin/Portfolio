## Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm a professional violinist who is currently attempting to become proficient in the basics of coding, IT, and webdev.  This page will update as I learn new skills and will serve as a portfolio if/when I want to apply for a job in IT or software.  I'm also in the process of builing a 3D printed violin using the STL files and instructions found at the openfab.pdx [Modular Fiddle Project](https://openfabpdx.com/modular-fiddle/). 

### Learning Resources: 

Currently I am using the following resources to teach myself:

* [Hopper's Roppers](https://hoppersroppers.org) 
  * This website, created by Dennis Devey, is a free, self-paced resource for learning the basics of computing, programming, and infosec. It gets its name from Grace Hopper, the inventor of the first compiler, and the term ROP (Return Oriented Programming, AKA hacking).  
* GitHub's free series of tutorials: 
  * [First Day on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-day-on-github)
  * [First Week on Github](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-week-on-github)
* Professor Messer's [CompTIA A+ training Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS9MJjNK6gA&list=PLG49S3nxzAnlGHY8ObL8DiyP3AIu9vd3K)
* and various other youtube and online resources as I find them through google.
